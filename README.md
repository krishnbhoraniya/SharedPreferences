# SharedPreferences

ðŸŒ  Using SharedPreferencesDelegate we can handle share preference feature in our project very easily

**For example:**

<pre>
//Variable initialization
private var id by intSP("YourKey")

//We can assign value directly like this
id = 2

//In other screen 
//There are separate variable for this field
//And you can directly get value from that variable
println(id)
</pre>
